Intelectual Property Regime to the East. It may be too late for America, but
there is an Eastern solution.
Many symptoms of the rotting of the American society have become more clear in
the past several years. The absolute total failure of health care, lack of
truth in mainstream American media, bogus invasions of sovereign land are some
such symptoms. These in turn signal failures of the professions of Journalism,
Medicine and Politics in America.
The ill that has brough these symptoms is that capitalism kills professions.
There are measures that members of each profession should take to defend their
profession. The key measure that I focus on for my profession (Software
Engineering) is the rejection of Intelectual Property regime.",

   abstract      = "This document describes the long-term strategic vision for Neda's By* family of
Libre Services. Additionaly it creates a framework for cooperative exection of
that vision.
As By* Libre Services are copyleft and patent-free, the entire concept is
positioned as an instance example for operation in the for-profit non-
proprietary quadrant.
Our vision and plans are lofty, ambitious and extensive. We have spent
considerable effort articulating our vision and inviting participation of
others. All in one place our full vision as a collection of articles is
publicly available in this document.
The basic underlying principles of our vision are these:
    * The correct model for software is the Free Software model
    * The correct model for Internet Services is the Libre Services model
    * The correct model for a coherent set of Libre Services is the By* unified
      model
By \"correct\" we mean that these models bring far greater benefits than their
proprietary counterparts. The benefits we speak of are not a set of abstract
idealizations, conceived without reference to the practical realities of the
world. The Free and Libre models bring real and practical benefits to all
relevant constituencies, including societal, engineering, and business.
The Free Software model is now well established as a viable reality, and is
being energetically moved forward by others. Our strategic vision concerns the
second underlying principle: the Libre Services model. Our goal is to establish
Libre Services as a viable model for delivery of Internet Services, and
eventually as the dominant model, worldwide.
The realization of this ambition has two major dimensions: public, and private.
    * The public dimension. In contrast to the proprietary services model,
      Libre Services are a commnunal public resource, not owned by anyone,
      freely available for use by society at large. Development and promotion
      of the general Libre Services model must therefore take place in a non-
      commercial, public context. The general Libre Services movement is being
      led by the Free Protocols Foundation (FPF), a non-profit organization
      dedicated to the maintenance of patent-free protocols and software. For
      more information visit the FPF website at: http://www.freeprotocols.org/
    * The private dimension. If Libre Services are to come into widespread
      usage they must be operated, delivered and supported for end users. In
      practical terms, this is something that must be done by service providers
      in a private, commercial context. Somewhere in all this there must be a
      business model that supports delivery of Libre Services to individual
      users.
      Neda Communications, Inc. is exercising leadership in the commercial
      arena. We have formulated an appropriate business model, and we are the
      first company to deploy and operate Libre Services in a commercial
      context. For more information visit the Neda website at: http://
      www.neda.com/
The public dimension of this initiative is fully described in a document called
the Libre Services Manifesto, written and published by the FPF. This document
is available at: http://www.libreservices.org/
The present document, titled Neda Strategic Direction Statement, provides a
complete description of Neda's long-term business direction and strategy. Our
strategy is based fundamentally on the Libre Services model, and therefore a
complete understanding of our strategy also requires a complete understanding
of the Libre Services model. This document therefore includes the Libre
Services Manifesto as a subset. This document also includes a description of
the commercial constructs Neda has built on top of the Libre Services model.
Our goal is to provide in a single document everthing required to understand
what we are doing.",

We have implemented a Libre solution using a Linux PDA (Nokia 810), local WiFi
for wireless device connectivity, and our own Libre Texting message center. The
result is complete, end-to-end Libre Texting functionality. In situations where
local WiFi is not available, we use MURS public wireless spectrum for wide area
connectivity. During the presentation we provide a live demonstration.

   abstract      = "This presentation document describes the deployment of By* Libre Services as a
new model for delivery of Internet Services. The presentation covers three
major topics:
   1. The Libre Services model
      Libre Services is a non-proprietary model for delivery of Internet
      services. Libre Services are an extension of the principles of free
      software into the Internet services domain. They are Internet services
      that can be freely copied and reused by anyone. Any company or
      organization can reproduce and host any Libre Service, either for its own
      use, or for commercial or non-commercial delivery to others. The Libre
      Services model exists in relation to the proprietary Internet services
      model of AOL, MSN, Yahoo and Google, in an analogous way to how GNU/Linux
      exists in relation to Microsoft Windows.
      A detailed description of the Libre concept is provided in the document
      titled, Libre Services: A non-proprietary model for delivery of Internet
      services, available at:
      http://www.freeprotocols.org/PLPC/100105
   2. The By* Services model
      Libre Services is a development and deployment model, but it says nothing
      about service functionality. By* (pronounced \"by-star\") is a specific
      implementation of the Libre model. By* is a unified services model,
      unifying and making consistent a large number of services that today
      exist in functional isolation. It is a coherent, integrated family of
      services, providing the user with a comprehensive, all-encompassing
      Internet experience.
      The By* family presently includes ByName, ByAlias, ByMemory and BySMB/
      ForSMB. In the works and coming soon are additional services for
      individuals (ByFamily, ByNumber), services for personal and business
      interaction (ByWhere, ByEvent, ByTopic, ByInteraction, ByLookup,
      ByHookup), and software distribution services (BySource, ByBinary).
      The By* services are based on 100% free software and patent-free
      protocols, and are thus completely transparent and reproducible by
      anyone. They are a communal public resource, not owned by anyone, freely
      available for use by society at large.
      A complete description of By* is provided in the document titled, The By*
      Concept: A Unified Model for Internet Services, available at:
      http://www.neda.com/PLPC/110001
   3. The business model
      Though the Libre Services model is non-proprietary, in practical terms
      service deployment must remain largely within the for-profit sector.
      The Libre deployment model represents a radical shift of the Internet
      Services industry from the for-profit, proprietary quadrant, to the for-
      profit, non-proprietary quadrant. In this space the entire software for
      an Internet service remains a communal public resource in the trust of
      the engineering profession, while service deployment is driven forward by
      the full force of for-profit commercial motivations.
      Therefore an essential component of the Libre deployment model is its
      commercial dimension. A coherent business model is required to motivate
      service deployment by commercial service providers. A complete
      description of the business model is provided in the form of an Open
      Business Plan titled, The By* Family of Libre Services: The future of the
      Internet Services industry, available at:
      http://www.neda.com/StrategicVision/BusinessPlan",

existing proprietary Texting solutions such as BlackBerry, but (a) based
entirely on patent-free protocols and free software, (b) using any mobile
Internet device, (c) wherever any type of wireless Internet connectivity is
available. The proposed approach comprises five elements: (1) the inherent
propagative power of the Free Software and end-to-end models, (2) an overlay
network architecture, (3) a new set of messaging protocols, (4) a novel
software architecture for Message Transfer Agent integration, and (5) a new
software architecture for multiform device integration, based on Device-
Resident End-MTA middleware. The proposed technology is highly synergistic with
current industry dynamics, including: burgeoning recognition of the power of
FOSS, ready availability of Linux-based mobile devices, and widespread Wi-Fi
availability. Existing email protocols lack push-mode delivery, and bandwidth
and power efficiency; the proposed new protocol profile corrects these
shortcomings. The proposed research is to determine feasibility of all critical
elements of this approach at large scale.",

\"Libre Texting: A Reshaping of the Medium.\"
The proposal was submitted by Neda Communications, Inc. to the Small Business
Innovation Research (SBIR) program of the National Science Foundation (NSF) on
June 9, 2009. The proposal was declined by the NSF. We received notification of
this decision, along with the review comments, on November 02, 2009.
We examined the NSF review comments closely, subjecting them to our own
internal analysis and discussion. Our conclusion is that they are almost
entirely incorrect, representing a near-total lack of understanding by the
reviewers of the substance of the proposal. Based on this and our subsequent
interactions with the NSF, we also believe there are serious process issues
regarding NSF evaluation of non-proprietary SBIR proposals such as ours.
We have established this case study to enable open consideration and discussion
of these issues. The case study documents the entire trajectory of our
proposal, from its initial submission through to its ultimate disposition. In
particular, the case study includes our own counter-analysis of the NSF review
comments. Here we provide point-by-point identification and clarification of
the many technical errors and misstatements contained within the review
comments.
The case study also includes references and pointers to all other relevant
materials, including the original SBIR proposal, and the NSF review comments.
These materials are web published and freely available online for examination
by anyone.",

no longer a novelty. Text-to-speech products with unlimted vocabulary are
available. Soon, these products will be incorporated into telephone based
inquiry systems that will give users access to data-bases from any phone. These
systems would enable ordinary telephone sets to function as limited computer
terminals. To accomplish this, in addition to the ability of sending
information to the user in the form of computer generated speech, the system
should be capable of accepting the data transmitted by the telephone (entries
on the keypad of a Touch-Tone telephone set).
The aim of this project has been to study possible approaches leading to
implementation of a system that would enable a computer to fully use an
ordinary telephone set. The six major functions associated with using the phone
are:
   1. Picking-up the receiver
   2. Dialing a number
   3. Talking (transmitting information)
   4. Listening (receiving information)
   5. Hanging-up
   6. Recognizing the ring.
Lifting and replacing the receiver is accomplished by using a solenoid that
mechanically controls the cradle switch. Dialing is implemented by generating
DTMF signals on the voice channel. A Votrax SC-01 phoneme synthesizer enables
the system to talk. A MSD 3201 CMOS DTMF decoder/receiver can provide the
ability to accept information (listen). Ring recognition may be accomplished
through the use of a sound switch.
By using the above mentioned functions, a computer could allow for the use of
an ordinary telephone set as a limited terminal. Although not in the form of a
%Gï¬%@nal product and totaly operational, the outcome of this project
demonstrates the feasability and the practicality of implementing means of
interaction between a computer and an ordinary telephone set.",

This document facilitates writing in Persian with Emacs. Emacs is the ultimate
multilingual customizable editor centered user environment. Emacs is the base
for By*'s choice of user environment in the Halaal/Convivial quadrant. Multiple
Persian input methods are part of the emacs distribution. This document
provides complete information for these input methods.
Emacs comes with two built-in Persian input methods:
  farsi-isiri-9149:
      A Persian keyboard based on the Islamic Republic of Iran’s ISIRI-9147
      specification.
  farsi-transliterate-banan:
      An intuitive transliteration keyboard for Farsi.
      The ISIRI-9147 Persian keyboard is not well suited to Iranian expatriates
      living in the West. Persian-speaking expatriates are usually already
      completely familiar and accustomed to the standard qwerty keyboard, and
      they don’t want to have to learn and adapt to ISIRI-9147. Rather, they
      expect software to adapt to them.
      This is what “Banan Multi-Character (Reverse) Transliteration Persian
      Input Method” – accomplishes.
      Consider that we want to write:
      حالا، با نرم افزار حلال میتوانیم به فارسی سالم بنویسیم.
      Note that we are not writing in pinglish. Ignore the vowels and think of
      the Persian writing above letter-by-letter.
      Now type:
      Hala, ba nrm afzar Hlal mitvanim bh farsi salm bnvisim.
      It is as simple as that.
Full conformance to ISIRI-6219 is demonstrated by use of the character mapping
tables enumerated in ISIRI-6219.
Based on this effort, various suggestions for improving ISIRI-9147 and ISIRI-
6219 are included in this document.
Emacs comes with a rich mail reader, a personal planner, an address book, a
calendar, spell checkers for English and Persian, multi-lingual dictionary
interfaces and many other tools and packages; all integrated together. Because
Emacs supports Persian, all these tools and packages also support Persian.
Most Iranians today use Microsoft Windows products such as MS Word and MS
PowerPoint in the Haraam/Industrial quadrant. Microsoft Windows is closed,
proprietary software made by an American corporation.
Our goal is to enable and encourage the transition of Iranians from the
proprietary Microsoft Windows products in the Haraam/Industrial quadrant, to
the far superior Emacs in the Halaal/Convivial quadrant.
This document provides enough information to enable anyone to obtain Emacs and
begin using it as her/his Persian user environment.",

In this document we properly introduce into Globish the concepts of Abstract
Halaal and Abstract Haraam.
In the domain of morality, ethics and philosophy, English is extremely weak.
Fundamental concepts from other cultures such as Halaal and Haraam are entirely
absent from English. And previous attempts to translate these terms into
English have been miserable failures. This is because these are complex
concepts that do not exist within the value system of the Americans and
British.
Most broadly speaking, the word halaal حلال is a facility for expressing
general moral sensibilities which map to ``right.'' The word haraam حرام is a
facility for expressing general moral sensibilities which map to ``wrong.''
We build the above formulation based on a framework for moral philosophy in the
abstract that is presented in this document.
Our primary purpose in doing so is to use these terms in the context of
``halaal software'' and ``halaal Internet services.''",

delivery to others. The Libre Services model exists in relation to the
proprietary Internet services model of AOL, MSN, Yahoo and Google, in an
analogous way to how GNU/Linux exists in relation to Microsoft Windows.
In essence, the Libre Services model represents a proposed definition of the
free software ideology within the services domain. We have articulated the
Libre model fully in the form of an industry paper titled, \"Libre Services: a
non-proprietary model for delivery of Internet services,\" available online at
http://www.freeprotocols.org/PLPC/100101.
The interested reader can choose to read more, or less, than this defining
paper. For the reader wishing to read less, the key ideas are summarized in the
form of a brief Executive_Summary.
And for the reader wishing to read more, the Libre concept paper is itself part
of a larger set of papers collectively called the \"Libre Services Manifesto,\"
describing every aspect of the Libre model, including a project-based model for
collaborative participation and bootstrapping. The full manifesto is available
at http://www.freeprotocols.org/PLPC/100105.",

integration) â Inside of Firefox: edit everything through Emacs, Send emails
using Emacs+Gnus, â¦ â Inside of Emacs: write html and view it in native
firefox in realtime, View all your Gnus email messages in full html in firefox,
â¦ Think of Emacs and Firefox as joint sisters. They are all you need. â
Incredible Email capabilities Built on top of Gnus. Awsome Multi-Mailbox and
Multi-Address support provided with ByStar. Great Anti-Spam capabilities,
Search Capabilities, Scoring based on full integration with the address book.
Mailing lists access through News with Gmane. â Organizational Tools the
likes of which exists no where else: Address Book: bbdb (Big Brother DataBase),
Calendar/Diary, Org Mode: To Do Lists, Worklogs, Dynamic Blocks, â Full
Integration With dict (Multi-Lingual Dictionaries, Thesarus, â¦), Powerfull
templating systems and Abbreviations. â Fully Multi-Lingual (m17n). Emacs 24
now includes bidi (bidirectional editing). That means in addition to Latin

   abstract      = "Traditionally business plans have been highly confidential and quite limited in
audience. The business plan itself is generally regarded as secret. However the
emergence of free software and open source has opened the model and made the
notion of an open business plan possible. An open business plan is a business
plan with unlimited audience. The business plan is typically web published and
made available to all. In the free software and open source business model,
trade secrets, copyright and patents can no longer be used as effective locking
mechanisms to provide sustainable advantages to a particular business and
therefore a secret business plan is less relevant in those models. While the
origin of the open business plan model is in the free software and Libre
Services arena, the concept is likely applicable to other domains. In theory, a
business plan has many uses and purposes. As a strategic plan it gives the
organization its direction, defines priorities, guides allocation of resources,
defines goals, objectives, processes and strategies; and identifies and focuses
the business on specific markets and revenue sources. In practice most business
plans are none of the above. Instead they are purely a tool for fundraising.
The dotCon era (late 1990s) demonstrated how business plans can become an
agreement document between entrepreneurs and Venture Capitalists on how to
engage in spin and flip and pump and dump activities. That makes the
requirement for the business plan being secret even stronger. In what we
believe is a first in the history of business practice, we are publishing our
business model in the form of an Open Business Plan. The plan is freely
available on our website to be read by anyone. The primary url for Neda's Open
Business Plan is: http://www.neda.com/StrategicVision/BusinessPlan Our business
model of not using the locking mechanisms of trade secrets, copyright and
patents plus the notion of an open business plan is very difficult to digest
for Venture Capitalists. Yet, the scope and scale of what we are trying to do
requires facilitation of external participation including capital investment.
Our engagement with Venture Capitalists typically starts here: http://
www.neda.com/StrategicVision/Participating/Investment/StartHere Insisting on
this honest and transparent model has come at a price. We point with pride to
the fact of having been thrown out of the offices of some of the most
prestigious high-technology venture capital companies in the Pacific Northwest.
In this presentation, we will provide an overview of the model that we have
been following and the lessons we have learned from interacting with VCs. We
believe that open source software engineers are best positioned to pave the way
towards making widespread the concept of open business plans. We highly
encourage those wishing to attend this presentation to page through this
example open business plan.",
